            <p>The world of web developing or programming is a huge world. If you want to build yourself here, you have
                to stick to it because you have to learn a lot of programming languages and you have to learn them again
                and again whenever new updates come. Otherwise you have to fall behind others..</p>

        <h2 class="margin">Youth For Humanity</h2>
        <p>Young people are the hope of a country. If they are on the right path, the country and society will move
            forward. <br> <br>

            Many people still live on the streets in this country, spend their days helplessly, do not get proper food,
            do not get medical treatment. <br> <br>

            Only we, the youth, can change these conditions. This society will become beautiful if we extend a helping
            hand to all these helpless people. So let's raise our voices at the beginning of the new year</p>
